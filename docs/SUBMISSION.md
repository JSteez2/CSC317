## Implementation Overview
I built a vanilla-JS calculator (`calculator.html`, `calculator.css`, `calculator.js`) that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percent, sign toggle, decimal inputs, and keyboard controls. The UI uses a CSS grid with distinct colors for operators, utilities, and numbers. Part 0’s “Hello, JavaScript!” demo shows basic ES6 usage. I then integrated the calculator into my portfolio under a “Projects” section with a project card and navigation links.

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Decimal & Zero Handling:** Prevented multiple decimals and leading‑zero issues by checking `current.includes('.')` and resetting on first number entry.
- **Division by Zero:** Display “Error” when dividing by zero.
- **Keyboard Support:** Mapped key presses to the existing click logic for a seamless experience.
