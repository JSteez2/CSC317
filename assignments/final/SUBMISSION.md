## Group Project Reflection

Building the Budget Planner as a group (https://csc317-group-e.onrender.com/) was a valuable end-to-end exercise in full-stack web development and team collaboration. Key takeaways:

1. **Architecture & Integration**  
   - We designed a clear separation between front-end, back-end, and data layers: a React/vanilla-JS UI for adding and viewing transactions, an Express API for CRUD operations, and MongoDB to persist user data.  
   - Integrating these pieces taught me how to structure routes, handle CORS, and coordinate asynchronous calls so that the UI always reflects the latest server state.

2. **Deployment & DevOps**  
   - Deploying the app to Render demonstrated the importance of environment variables, build scripts, and health checks. I learned to write a `Procfile` (or equivalent) and configure a production-ready Node environment.  
   - Setting up automatic redeploys on push improved my confidence in continuous delivery practices.

3. **Team Processes & Version Control**  
   - We adopted a feature-branch workflow with pull requests and code reviews. This minimized merge conflicts and kept our `main` branch stable.  
   - Daily stand-ups and a shared Kanban board ensured everyone knew their responsibilities—whether building the “Add Transaction” form, writing validation logic, or styling the dashboard.

4. **Usability & Responsiveness**  
   - Through iterative design reviews, I refined how forms provide immediate feedback on invalid input, and how the budget-limit feature alerts users when they exceed their targets.  
   - Ensuring the layout adapted across mobile and desktop screens strengthened my CSS Flexbox/Grid skills and my understanding of accessibility best practices.

Overall, this project solidified my ability to take a collaborative idea from concept to a live, fully deployed application—balancing code quality, user experience, and operational reliability.
