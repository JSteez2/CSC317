## HTML Personal Portfolio Website Assignment

### Description:
The goal of this assignment was to create a personal portfolio website using HTML. This website serves as an online showcase of my background, education, and projects, helping me build a digital presence and demonstrate my technical skills.

### Approach / What I Did:
I used structured HTML elements to create a personal portfolio webpage for this HTML assignment.  Creating a well-structured layout with sections for school, experience, personal information, and photos was the goal. A table for accomplishments, an unordered list for schooling, and headings for distinct division separation are all included in the design.  I included pictures of my hometown and school logo while making sure the file paths were correct for display.  The layout adheres to a clear, basic structure to facilitate easy navigation.

### Code Explanation:

'''<nav>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#education">Education</a></li>
        <li><a href="#experience">Experience</a></li>
        <li><a href="#projects">Projects</a></li>
        <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
'''

The "nav" element contains a list of links for easy navigation and the "a" tags reference section IDs for smooth scrolling.

  '''<h3>Relevant Courses & Achievements</h3>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Course</th>
            <th>Institution</th>
            <th>Year</th>
        </tr>
        '''
        
The "table" organizes coursework details and "th" is used for column headings, and "td" for data entries.
